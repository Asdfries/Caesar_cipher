# Caesar_cipher

The caesar_cipher is a method that takes a string of text and a number and shifts each individual letter down the alphabet the number of characters given in the input.  

Ex: Given the letter "a" and the number 2 the output would be "c".  Given the word "Happy" and the number 3 the output would be "Kdssb".  


caesar_cipher does not affect capitalisations or the punctuations ',.!? all other non letter charicters returns and error.
